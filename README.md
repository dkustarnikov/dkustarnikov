# Dmitry Kustarnikov

## Software Developer | Cloud Architect | Systems Thinker

I build systems that scale, solve problems that matter, and design APIs that feel like they were meant to be. With 3+ years of experience in full-stack development, I specialize in cloud-native applications using AWS, .NET, and React/TypeScript.

I enjoy solving complex technical challenges, optimizing infrastructure, and contributing to forward-thinking teams that care about clean code and clear outcomes.
